# `leetcode-go`

This is a simple project for being able to work on LeetCode problems and catalog solutions with tests to verify correctness while I'm learning GoLang.

**Don't judge me for how yucky this repo may be, this is my first foray into writing anything with Go!**

To run tests:

```bash
go test <PATH_TO_TESTS>

# e.g.
go test ./arrays
go test ./arrays/contains_duplicate_test.go
```

More info on `go test` can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/testing).
