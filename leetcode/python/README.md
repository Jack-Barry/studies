# `leetcode-python`

This is a simple project for being able to work on LeetCode problems and catalog solutions with tests to verify correctness while I'm brushing up on Python.

**Don't judge me for how yucky this repo may be, I haven't written much Python for several years!**

To run tests:

```bash
python <PATH_TO_TEST_FILE>

# e.g.
python ./arrays/contains_duplicate_test.py
```

Note that this project was written using Python version `3.12`
