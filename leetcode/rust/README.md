# `leetcode-rust`

This is a simple project for being able to work on LeetCode problems and catalog solutions with tests to verify correctness while I'm learning Rust.

**Don't judge me for how yucky this repo may be, I still have a lot to learn with Rust!**

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test <PATH_TO_TEST>

# e.g.
cargo test arrays
cargo test arrays::contains_duplicate
```

More info on `cargo test` can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html) or by running `cargo test --help`.
